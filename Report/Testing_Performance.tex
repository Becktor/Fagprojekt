\chapter{Testing and performance analysis}

To test our performance our only marker has been frames per second. The Gameduino 2 and the Arduino support 60 fps. Throughout the project we have gone up and down in our fps. We found that to remove the delay from our nunchuck buttons we had to update it twice. This had a heavy toll on our fps count though. We used the double update until the start of the three week period. We removed one of the updates and observed that we no longer had any delay and we once again achieved 60 fps. The game has been running decently, but we have had some issues with coins spawning outside the map and inside blocks which make them flicker across the screen but this happens infrequently. Our code size has gone to the exact limit of what the board's flash memory could hold.
