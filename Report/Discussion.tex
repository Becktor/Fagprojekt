\chapter{Discussion}
 
One of our biggest problems here towards the end has been the amount of flash memory. This set a limit for what we could add and how we could add it. Some places in our code we have had to implement some things rather crudely to save flash memory, an example is that we have not used any getters/setters all is done with public variables. We have also had problems the amount we could store on our GD2 file this limited us to a few selected sprites and audio files. Furthermore we have had some issues with spawning coins.\\
If we wanted to add additional features to our game we would have to do it on another arduino with more memory. We could have implemented the features we wanted originally, story, more monsters, items, levels and so on.\\
We have been very limited by arduino capacities.
