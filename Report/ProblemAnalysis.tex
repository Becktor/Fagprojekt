\chapter{Problem Analysis}
We aim to implement a game on the Arduino which runs reasonably well with the following features:
-Solid platformer mechanics
-Clever enemies
-Random maps

\section{Requirements Specification}
The usual platformer mechanics is moving and jumping. The movement should feel responsive and natural, which would include some simple physics engine to conserve momentum. The enemies should prove a challenge to the player, but also be more advanced than simply walking left to right. The random maps should be different enough to provide a varied gameplay experience.
We want simple yet easily recognizable imagery. Animations should include smooth transitions and it should be easy for the player to feel like he or she is truly in control of their character's actions in the game. There shouldn't be any points in gameplay where it's confusing as to what exactly is happening on screen. Essentially the game should look nice but still keep the sense of retro genre game. To give the game a purpose, we want to add a highscore system. High scores is something you almost always see in arcade games or just smaller games. Its a great way to compare and compete and to show who's the best.
\newline
Coin were added as an additional game play element to broaden the game. The player now has an incentive to go explore the entirety of the map, since collecting coins is an easy way to get additional score.
