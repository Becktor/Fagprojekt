       \section{Timeplan}%Cebrail/Jonathan

       There are several time planning models in the software world. There is agile, iterative
       and incremental.

       When we started the `Fagprojekt' we created a waterfall chart containing our plans
       for every week, it was structured in a waterfall chart. The waterfall system is a
       sequential design process.
       It is designed to get through the project phases and have a product as soon as
       possible. The phases in our project can be seen in the figure below.

       As we revisited our waterfall model steps over time, our main
       time plan model can be considered to be iterative. The revisits have mainly
       been to extend features,debugging or optimizing.

       When the waterfall ends and we still have time
       we will go back and visit the steps and check for new requirements.
       \\The waterfall gives
       a good picture of the big phases, but the pre-planned week schedules are
       not always much help, as they are not dynamic. We can't reconstruct our waterfall every
       time we meet a conflict. This is here where the timeboxes are handy, which is used
       to the most detailed part of the time planning - see next subsection.
       You can check our waterfall timeplan in the appendices, please
       see Figure~\ref{fig:Waterfall_chart} for that.

       \subsection{Time Boxing} %Jonathan
       We were conviced that using "Time Boxing" would be the way to go.
       Timeboxing divides The schedule into a number of separate time periods(timeboxes), with each part having its own deliverables, deadline and budget.
       Breaking bigger tasks into smaller tasks with better manageable time frames.
       What also is important is that by the end of each timebox we need to have a product that if all else fails we can roll back and release our game from an earlier state. The following table shows the timeboxes we have created during the project.

      \section{Hardware}
\subsection(Arduino problems)
Throughout our implementation of the game we have had several issues with our arduinos.

\subsubsection*{arduino burnout}	
The first problem we ran into was one of our arduino burned out. Or so we thought we gave it to our supervisor who had a look. He gave it back the day after where it worked but then 5 minutes later it simply died again. We have had this issue with the arduino since then it works and then it doesn’t. Were not sure whats causing it and have not been able to find anything explaining it.
This slowed us down somewhat since we now only had one arduino leonardo and a arduino duemilanove.
\subsubsection*{arduino duemilanove.}
We ran out of flash memory on the duemilanove since it only has 16kb flash memory, this set us back since we only had 1 arduino to code on. We later got this replaced with another leonardo
\subsubsection*{arduino blackout}
We have also had some issues when uploading code to the arduino. Sometimes the arduino screen is black after uploading. To fix this we had to upload an example file from the arduino library that prints text to the screen.
