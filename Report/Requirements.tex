\subsection{Gameplay}%Jonathan
We originally wanted to implement a rpg style platformer with:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Items
\item Hero leveling
\item Abilities
\item A decent story
\end{enumerate}
We quickly found out that the limited flash memory on the arduino would greatly limit what we could implement. We agreed on going back to the classics of arcade games. We decided to create a "rogue like" game and focus on increasing difficulty per level and having a high score as the intensive to play the game.

High Score.
So High scores is something you almost always see in arcade games or just smaller games. Its a great way to compare and compete and to show who's the best. 
To do this we were requierd to save data on the EEPROM which is the "hard drive" of the arduino. This way the high score will never reset unless we want it to.

Coins were added as an additional gameplay element to broaden the game. This way the player now has an incentive to explore the entirety of the map, since collecting coins is an easy way to get additional score.


\subsection{The algorithms}
In order to implement the enemy motions and map generation, we'll have to create our
own algorithms.



\subsection{Timeplan} %Cebrail/Jonathan
Our timeplan follows an agile development system called waterfall.
The waterfall system is a sequential design process.
It is designed to get through the project phases and have a product as soon as
possible. The phases in our project can be seen in the figure below.

\subsubsection{Project management}
When the waterfall ends and we still have time
we will go back to the start and check for new requirements
and the whole waterfall process starts again.
The report is both written seamlessly and separately in the end of the project,
therefore it does not has to be illustrated, as it will create confusion.

\subsection{Time Boxing} %Jonathan


\subsubsection{Tasks management}%Cebrail
When providing the tasks we use the timeboxing method.
This method increases the productivity significantly.
Timeboxing works by breaking a big task into smaller tasks with better manageable time frames.
It kinda works like a stopwatch. The following table shows the timeboxes we have
created during the project.
