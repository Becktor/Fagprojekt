%Something goes here.

\section{Components}
Sketch files, c++/c language, includes, standard libraries
Arduino sketch is the Arduino IDE, we have worked with it several months its built upon IDE form the Processing programming language. We have had a few quams with it. Firstly the syntax highlighting is not completely correct, second the structure of the ino file and all its cpp/h files where all tabs need to be open is just plain confusing.

Arduino programs are written in C or C++. The Arduino IDE comes with a software library called "Wiring" from the original Wiring project, which makes many common input/output operations much easier. Users only need define two functions to make a runnable cyclic executive program: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item setup():a function that runs when board is powered on.
\item loop():a function called repeatedly until the board powers off
\end{enumerate}
Nunchuk library
The inputs are recieved using the {\tt ArduinoNunchuk}\footnote{http://www.gabrielbianconi.com/arduinonunchuk/} library.
It uses the {\tt wire.h} library that is included in the Arduino IDE.
Using the {\tt wire.h}library makes it possible to communicate with the
nunchuk using the I2C interface.\\
The library includes following methods, which are updated every time {\tt nunchuk.update();} is called:\\
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item nunchuk.analogY
    \item nunchuk.analogY
    \item nunchuk.accelX

    \item nunchuk.accelZ
    \item nunchuk.zButton
    \item nunchuk.cButton
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

Linked list library is also one we found it is simply an implementation of linked lists which we use to store our units, hero and our coins.

GD2 libary is needed for the
Here are the functions that we use from the GD2 library:

\section{Structure} %Carsten
A platforming game would need at least a simple physics engine, supporting momentum and acceleration. Player movement feels more natural, and allows us to make attacks push units. Only actors would need to be affected by the physics engine, but we extended it to allow all props - this was both an optimization and an additional feature in the game. We discuss these implications in the implementation chapter.

\section{Setup}
Setup is where we instantiate most local variables, our hero, units, props and lists of our units. We also generate our random seed and load our assets, the GD prerequisites and a millisecond counter.

\section{Loop} %Carsten/Jonathan
The loop first sets the millisecond counter then it gets data from the nunchuk update. Afterwards it updates all units AI, where they decide what to do in this frame. The hero is part of this loop and updated as if he had AI, but instead converts player input(that we got from the nunchuk update) into actions. After this, all attacks generated from this AI update is executed. This involves all props, where units are checked if they die and coins are checked if they are collected. Finally the physics is updated, and all props move according to their internal velocities. Minotaurs may update their AI in case a collision function is called.
\newline
Attacks are cleared, sound for the attack is played and it checks whether the hero's health is zero. If it is we restart the game and save the score if its a highscore.
%Essentially the game is one long loop, which ends whenever the game does. Each iteration executes the gamelogic per frame, such as moving the player and monsters around. Gameloops vary from simple while(true) loops to dynamic separate gameloops handling separate calculations (such as separating rendering from gameplay).For this we only needed a simple game loop, updating the world in each iteration. To ensure a consistent gameplay experience, we needed to know how much time passes betweenframe updates. Without this, the game would run faster or slower on different processors or inconsistently in different ingame events, throwing off the players’ sense of timing. For example, the game would be equally playable with either 30 or 60 frames per second. If the difference isn’t incorporated in the gamelogic though,the game would run twice as fast with 60 frames per second! Our implementation of a frames per second counter, is simply calculating how many frames was calculated the last frame, and then assuming the next frame has the same amount. This is a pretty simple solution, which could easily be expanded upon if needed. The obvious criticism of this method, is that the frame calculations between each second are not accounted for, and that the framerate is essentially a second behind any framerate changes. OLD

\section{Logic} %Carsten
The units needs to receive map data and send actions. This is the {\tt Logic} class' function. It contains numerous methods to calculate a units' surroundings and also handles collision, physics engine, coin collection and attacks.\\
Props can only collide with the map geometry, not with each other. It was not a priority to collide props with each other. Enemies should be able to pass each other and the hero would be damaged when colliding with them in any case. Collision is calculated in straight lines, and only at one axis at a time. This makes long diagonal movement inaccurate, since it is calculated as if the prop moved first horizontally and then vertically. A better collision detection was a possibility, but eventually not prioritized. Collisions are calculated according to rectangular hitboxes.
\newline
After these simplifications, the collision algorithm is very simple. Given a prop and a distance, it checks each tile in order which the prop will pass through according to its hitbox. If any of the tiles are solid, the prop only travels up to the solid tile and the algorithm terminates. When updating the physics engine, either the {\tt collisionX} or {\tt collisionY} functions are called, used in AI for units or bounce in coins.
\newline
A linked list of attacks between frames is kept. Units add their attacks to the list during AI updates and the list is cleared after the attacks have been executed. Executions goes through each prop and checks whether the attack hits or not, calling the {\tt hit} function in case it has. Attacks are a separate object, containing damage, push force, the owner and the area. The attacks are only instantiated once at unit instantiation, which only manipulates the area when reusing the attack, thus optimizing on computing time, though costing memory.
\newline
There is a circular reference, since units require logic which requires scene which in turn requires units. This resulted in forward declarations in scene which is a bit inelegant. It was difficult to design a structure which did not have any circles, since the actors act upon the scene, and the scene returns data to the actor.

\section{Units}
Units are a subclass of prop, reusing all physics related functions and fields.

\subsection*{Minotaurs} %Carsten
The only implemented enemy is the minotaur from Greek myth. His behaviors range from wandering, charging, hunting and dead, which also has alternative settings while he is in air. Initially he wanders in some direction until he comes across a gap or hits a wall, where he turns around. The gap check is simply whether the space immediately below the front of his hitbox is empty or not, while {\tt collisionX} function is only called when he wanders horizontally into a wall, making the wall check easy.
hunting
\newline
Currently the only type of enemy is the minotaur, though the current framework was built to contain multiple types.

\subsection*{Hero}
Our hero has its own class where we define the movements, the hitbox and
the animation handler.
\newline
Our hero has two speeds, walking and running. By using values from the nunchuk library we can determine whatever our hero should stay idle, walk or run. As an example, if the difference between {\tt analogX} and rest value {\tt NUNCHUK\_REST\_X} is 50 or more, our hero will run to the direction specified in the class. When this happens the acceleration and speed are set to the specified constants in the header file.  A similar method is also used for ducking, if {\tt analogY} is lower than 45, our hero will duck. In this case, the hitbox will change height and y-value. The y-value has to be changed because hitboxes are defined at the top left corner. The hitbox is used to detect collisions - see subsection Logic for more detail.
\newline
Attacking and jumping are far simpler as they only check the variables {\tt zButton} and {\tt cButton} for a {\tt true} value. They can though only be executed again once their local variables {\tt \_isAttacking} and {\tt \_isJumping} are false. This will prevent errors as jumping continuously. We did also ensure that our hero can't duck and attack at the same time. He is though able to jump and attack in the air. When attacking in the air, the handler uses the attack animation, it changes back to jump handler as soon as the button is released.

\section{Scenes} %Carsten
Scenes are the objects Containing the map data and all props within. The map is a simple two-dimensional array. The element at two given indexes corresponds to a tile, which has coordinates equal to the two given indexes times the size of a tile. This means world- can easily be converted to tile coordinates or vice versa.
\newline
In addition to the map, the scene also contain all props, which is the hero, minotaurs and coins. It stores this in two places: in dynamic linked lists, and in arrays. The former is for dynamic removal of the props, when the coins are collected or the minotaurs are killed. These are used when updating gameplay, to make sure that unused props are not updated, increasing framerate. The latter is for storing all available props , used at map generation. The arrays have a couple of advantages. First they create all used props of each type initially, reusing the same minotaurs and coins in each map. This shortens time needed to allocate and deallocate memory. Additionally, if the amount of props is initially within Arduino's memory bounds, then the maps will never cause the Arduino to run out of memory, since it never allocates more. The obvious drawbacks is that we are limited in the amount of props we need, and that removing any props during play does not increase available memory. The second drawback isn't that much of a problem though, since very little is needed during play.
\newline
Currently, because of an implementation bug, the props are dynamically allocated, even though they shouldn't need be.
%Additional possible datastructures?

\subsection*{Generator} %Carsten
Map generation is executed at setup and whenever the game ends (either by player death or win). The method {\tt newScene} generates a new map with matching points at the entrance and exits. Arduino's programming language does not support returning more than one value, so the method manipulates given pointers instead like in C programming. The new map data overwrites the old one to save time and space, so the given {\tt scene} argument is a pointer to the old scene.  Reusing it saves us from instantiating a new one and deallocating the old one.  We ar not interested in reusing the actual map data, since the player cannot revisit prior levels.
\newline
The actual algorithm is in three parts: clearing, modulation and generation. First it clears the old map data, setting all tiles to {\tt NONE}, to make sure nothing is left over from the old map. This may be a bit expensive on the processing time considering it is superfluous if the generator works correctly. The reason is a design choice which will be apparent when we reach the generation. %Picture of Modules?
\newline
Modulation in this case means separating the map into \emph{modules}\footnote{As opposed to vary the pitch in a voice}. This is where the layout of the map is decided. A module is a small map in itself, in our case a 5x5 map of tiles.  These have been designed by hand and hard-coded into the generator. Every map is construed of a grid of modules, in our case 4x4. The modules are differentiated by which sides one can access it from.  By this we mean the player can traverse from and to this module from the given sides.  The types are left-right (corridor), left-right-up (T-up), left-right-down (T-down), all (cross) and none (closed). A module in the category left-right is guaranteed to have an exit left and right, and may have an exit up or down.
\newline
The algorithm first instantiates a grid of empty modules, and randomly assigns one of the bottom modules to be a corridor and the entrance. This is the beginning of the solution path, which guarantees that the map can be completed by the player. From then on it picks a direction, left or right, randomly. From then on the algorithm randomly either moves according to its direction or up. When moving sideways the newly visited grid space is assigned to be a corridor. If it hits the edge of the map it moves upwards and changes direction instead. Whenever the solution path moves upwards, the algorithm has to change the space it is in first. If it is in a corridor tile, it changes it to a T-up, and if it is a T-down it changes it to a cross module. Both of these are the same as their predecessors, but with a guaranteed top-side exit. The newly visited module is assigned a T-down module. The algorithm picks a new direction at random (only if it is not at an edge.) and can start the over again. When it attempts to move upwards while at the top, it instead places the exit in the current tile and terminates. All unvisited grid spaces are assigned closed modules, and are not part of the solution path. Thus we have reached a map which has a guaranteed solution.
\newline
Lastly the program generates the map. This step reads each module in the newly generated grid, randomly picks a module of the specified type, and fills it into the actual map. If it is currently in an entrance or exit room, it places the corresponding door. It changes the original given entrance and exit pointers to
point at the now created door.
\newline
Every module overlap with a single row or column with all surrounding modules. Overlapping follows a priority of tiles, where the algorithm determines which tile from the modules is used. Platforms are placed before empty tiles, and solid tiles are placed before platforms. This has several benefits. Firstly the maps are more unique since pairs of modules also differ, and makes the seams of modules harder to notice. Secondly, it ensures that upward exits are easier guaranteed since platforms can be placed closer to the upper floors. This is the reason we need to clear the map prior to generation: the old tiles would disrupt this priority, since the algorithm would not be able to discern what is old and what is new during
generation.

\subsection*{Highscore/?Randomseed? EEPROM}
Using EEPROM we implemented two functions $EEpromReadInt$ and $EEpromWriteInt$ which could save unsigned integers on the "hard drive" of the arduino. The functions work by bitshifting the integer with 0 and 8 and then save the two bitshifted values in the EEPROM. We 


\section{Gameduino 2}
\subsection*{Graphics}
\subsubsection*{Rendering}
The Gameduino 2 consists of an essential graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256 kilobytes of RAM. With it is the ability to draw virtually anything on the screen. 

\subsubsection*{Bitmaps}
With it there is support for drawing images, called 'bitmaps'. With the exception of the background and text, everything the player witnesses in our game consists of these bitmaps. Since images aren’t uploaded along with the code to the Arduino, we store them on a microSD card which conveniently can be read in real time from the Gameduino 2. The simplest way to read a single image off the card would be to directly load it to the GPU with a command in the code. Each image loaded in would be assigned to a specific address and could thereafter be drawn with the image’s top left corner at a given x-y coordinate. However, this method wouldn’t be able to fulfil the necessary requirements of what we had planned. This is where the Gameduino 2 asset converter comes in.

\subsubsection*{Assets}
The asset converter basically takes multiple media files, including images and sounds, and compiles them into a single asset file with the extension '.gd2'. As the abbreviation suggests, this file is specifically designed for the Gameduino 2 to read and gets placed on the SD card. Along with the asset file, a header file is generated to be included alongside the code in the associated project. The header file automatically defines constants associated with each image. There are four constants: handle, width, height, and cells. An image’s handle is its index in the array of images provided, e.g., the first image would have the handle, 0. The width and height simply state the dimensions of the image in pixels. The 'cells' variable states how many images are included in the handle. Essentially we used handles with multiple cells (images) instead of a single image to easily maintain each animation. Here we can see the process of creating simple walking and attacking animations for our hero. Once the header file is included in a project, its constants are ready to be called from the code and used to project animations onto the screen.

\newpage
\subsubsection*{Animation}
There are many ways to make sure an object in the game knows which handle it should use as well as which cell within the animation to display. The example in the Gameduino 2 reference utilizes both a sprite's x-coordinate and bit shifting as the object moves across the screen. This method however, is very primitive and specifically tailored to sprites moving from left to right. The way our program cycles through the cells of an animation is through time. \newline
Every object in the game that includes animation is a prop. That is to say the hero, minotaurs, and coins are all props. The prop class includes two functions directly related to animating: newHandle and updateAnimation. newHandle includes three parameters that get called from the specific object’s class every update. It starts by checking if it should change anything about the animation by first checking if {\tt \_animLock} boolean is true. {\tt \_animLock} assures that the animation can’t change until the current animation has gone through all its cells. We use this boolean when the hero attacks because he should finish an attack before reverting to reverting back to whichever movement animation he’s in. The function also checks if the new handle or frame rate are the same as the current ones. If the conditions are met, the three values are replaced with those associated with a new animation and current cell to be displayed is manually set to the first one in the sequence.\newline
The function, updateAnimation, receives the parameter, dTime, from the main class every update. The {\tt \_dtime} variable keeps track of the number of milliseconds that have passed since the last update, or run through of all the code. It’s used to keep the time interval between cells consistent with the time it takes to update the whole program. Every animation has a manually set frame rate which determines how many milliseconds should pass before changing to the next cell. The variable, {\tt \_aniTime}, simply adds the value of {\tt \_dTime} to itself every update until the compiled number of milliseconds passed surpasses that of the animation’s frame rate. When this happens, it’s time to move on to the next cell in the animation. If however, it’s the last cell, then it naturally reverts back to the first. One condition on resetting the cycle however that is that the {\tt \_aniStop} boolean isn’t used. This boolean is only used when an animation shouldn’t cycle back to its first cell. We use it primarily for death animations because when a unit dies it should stay dead. If the previously mentioned lock boolean is being used when a animation sequence resets, it isn’t required thereafter and set back to false. In any case, when a cell changes, the value of {\tt\_aniTime} is set back by the value of the animation’s frame rate so that it can once again accumulate time until it reaches the required frame rate value again for the next cell.

\subsubsection*{Drawing Sprites}
When the correct image to display is determined, there is still a matter of how to draw it and where exactly to place it. Rather than creating mirror image files we’re able to use the Gameduino functions to flip an image horizontally and still keep it at the same position. We intentionally made every sprite face to the right in the original images so we’d only have to flip them if they’re supposed to face left. As mentioned, everything that gets drawn with the Gameduino gets prepared and manipulated beforehand. In this case, the image gets flipped, drawn, then flipped back again in case a sprite is updated thereafter to face to the right again. \newline


\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.55\linewidth}

  \label{fig:minocoinhitbox}
\end{minipage}
  \caption{The purple hitbox represents the body of the probs}
\end{figure}




In terms of coordinate placement, the image would under usual circumstances share the same position and dimensions as the hitbox it’s registered to. However, our units have appendages/weapons/armor etc. which shouldn’t be included. Essentially we created sprites wherein the body of the characters is the same size as their respective hitbox and centred precisely in both the x and y axis on the whole image. It’s also vital that all the images tailored to a specific object have the same dimensions. This is due to the way we coded where in respect to an object’s hitbox the image should be drawn. Where each object includes specified hitbox dimensions, they also include image dimensions provided by the sprite header file. For each axis, the difference between half the image length and half the hitbox’s would be the distance between their centres if they were drawn at the same point. We simply subtract this value from the hitbox’s position in each axis respectfully and draw the image. Rather than sharing the same top left corner, the image and hitbox share centres.  When the image is always centred on the hitbox, it doesn’t matter if the hitbox changes size. This system is useful when we want to implement ducking because as long as the ducking images have the body of the figure centred and the same dimensions as all the object’s other images, the image will translate accordingly.


\subsection*{Sound}
The Gameduino 2 requires the sound files to be converted using the asset converter. Before including the
sounds in the GD2 file, we first convert them to an acceptable format. The assets converter only accepts
files with following properties: 
''They need to be in .wav format, audio channel set to mono, and bit resolution set to 16.''

The conversion process also includes reducing the sample rate of the sound. By doing so,
the file will not take as much space. Sometimes the sounds would get ruined by reducing too much,
so we had to find a balance between quality and size.


\section{Input}
Before implementing the nunchuk. We checked other alternatives. Both Arduino and the Gameduino 2 shield gives us opportunities to control the game. Arduino can communicate with a pc and get data when a key is pressed on the keyboard. The Gameduino 2 is equipped with a touch screen and a accelerometer. We could have used one of these to get input, but none of them gives a natural way to play a 'platformer` on a Gameduino 2. The pc solution feels not natural as the keyboard and the Gameduino 2 screen usually are not in front of each other. The touch screen is not as responsive as we wanted, and it would also be annoying as the fingers will get in the way. The accelerometer is just wrong in all way, it is hard to control, as you always has to 'guess' how to hold the device. The problem with fingers getting in the way appears also here. The best option was using an external controller - a Wii nunhcuk.



\section{Optimization} %Cebrail / Carsten
Officially the \emph{flash memory} has a capacity of 32 Kb, but the IDE does not allow uploading sketches larger than 28.672 bytes. Furthermore, the first 4242 bytes are reserved for the \emph{bootloader}, so in reality we only have 24.430 bytes of code available. %Explain flash memory & bootloader?
\newline
Early optimizations is usually the bane of programming, but halfway through development we hit the code size ceiling. The code size seemed to arbitrarily grow independent of the code additions. From then on, every single addition required an optimization at least of same size, and in the end we had to sacrifice some maintainability and readability to reach our goals. Development stopped when optimization work yielded less than a 100 bytes per hour, but at that point the game was feature complete, so it just saved us from gold plating. Figure~\ref{fig:code_size} is a graph of the code size during development.
\newline
Arduino's IDE did not make it easy for us to optimize the game. All warnings concerning dead code or unused variables and functions are suppressed. Allegedly, the warnings was thought to discourage new developers, and was removed. The compiler was already optimized to removed these parts of the code, but it does so silently to the developer.

\subsection*{Libraries} %Carsten / Cebrail
The extern libraries use a lot of space, especially true for the graphics library. It has been difficult to evaluate just how much space they use. For example, the difference in space between two and one function call, is the size of the call, but the difference between one and zero calls is the entire function plus the call. This is because the compiler cuts unused functions, and it makes it difficult to evaluate what parts of the code is expensive.
\newline
In any case, we could not do without the used extern libraries, nor would it be certain that we could rewrite them better. It would have taken too much time to optimize and test the libraries, and would probably not have been more profitable than optimizing our own code.

\subsection*{Verbosity} %Carsten
Maintainability is usually a great priority in programming, but the constraints of the Arduino left us to optimize for efficiency. In many cases the code was also left less readable and robust, in favor of using less space. There was, however, a certain limit where we did not simplify. For example, two version of the same method returns a random direction, either $-1$ or $1$:
\begin{verbatim}
char getRandDir() {
  if(random(2) == 0)
    return -1;
  else
    return 1;
}

char getRandDir() {
  return random(2) * 2 - 1;
}
\end{verbatim}
The first function is more expensive, but also a lot more readable. The second is absolutely incomprehensible, but cheaper. We went the top method, so the intent of the code was at least understandable. This case is more symbolic of the standard we held, since the top most function only cost 4 bytes more, but it serves as a good example. In the source code, the directions are replaced with the enumeration values {\tt LEFT} and {\tt RIGHT}. In other cases, for example the map generator, we split the code up in functions for readability.

\subsubsection*{Encapsulation} %Cebrail / Carsten
Usually it is good code practice to encapsulate variables and use getters and setters. This was a luxury we could not afford, which became apparent when we hit the ceiling. Most variables was made public, though in some cases a getter was cheaper than directly accessing the variable.

%Too obvious?
%\subsubsection{Repeated statements} %Cebrail
%Repeated statements - well it speaks for itself. Repeating something that has been calculated before is just a waste of code space. Simplifying the code in this manner is sometimes not easy, it requires that you think creative. It often requires you to think - is this needed? It may not always be obvious. Often it is about finding a shortcut to some calculation and taking advantage of already existing results.


\subsection*{Datatypes} %Cebrail
A good place to start was the datatypes. Converting the bigger datatypes to some smaller ones was a easy optimization. Mostly, it was integers that was converted to data types like {\tt char}, {\tt byte} and {\tt word}. Which {\tt char} is capably of encoding numbers from -128 to 127. While {\tt bytes} is a 8-bit unsigned number, from 0 to 255 and {\tt word} is basically an unsigned 16-bit number, from 0 to 65535. Notice that {\tt byte} is the unsigned version of {\tt char}. More details in arduinos site\footnote{http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage}.

\subsection*{Global Variables} %Carsten
Like Java's main function, Arduino has two special functions: {\tt setup} and {\tt loop}. The former is called once on program start, while the latter is repeatably called until the Arduino is turned off.\footnote{At least, we haven't discovered a way to terminate a sketch.} This isn't a very optimized structure. It forces us to use global variables if we want to reuse anything from setup in loop. Our solution was to leave {\tt loop} empty and put an endless loop in {\tt setup} instead. All of our variables could become local with this change, greatly reducing code size.

\subsection*{Inconsistencies} %Carsten
Finally, in some cases the code size arbitrarily increased or decreased where it should not have. For example, there are some unused values in the {\tt sprite.h}, which was generated by the asset converter. If these are removed, the code size increases. This is probably some inconsistency in the compiler, but we did not research this further. In other cases, where more code resulted in less code size, we removed the anomalies (or simply did not add them), but the asset converter values was discovered when space was really limited, so we had to leave it in.
