\subsection{Structure}
The AI needs to receive world information and deliver actions. This prompts a cyclic model-controller relationship, which aims to place as much freedom in the hands of the AI as possible. The biggest limiting factor is how complex the world is, most of all the physics engine. The AI cannot and should not predict how its actions would affect the world - this is the job of the physics engine.
