\subsection{Structure}
The AI needs to receive world information and deliver actions. This prompts a cyclic model-controller relationship, which aims to place as much freedom in the hands of the AI as possible. The biggest limiting factor is how complex the world is, most of all the physics engine. The AI cannot and should not predict how its actions would affect the world - this is the job of the physics engine. With

\subsection{Sound}
The game does have sound effects on essential events. Mostly of the sounds
are coming from movements of hero, which are jumping and attacking.
Beside that we have sound for exiting map and coin gain. As a simple
movement sound file can have a size up to 20Kb, we has to convert them. The converting
process includes: reducing the sampling rate, setting audio channel to mono and setting
the bit resolution to 16 bit. Reducing the sample rate can ruin the sound, so some files
will not be reduced as much as we wanted. The size is also the reason for not using a
background music. A solution would have been using short music, but we agreed that
looping would be annoying.
